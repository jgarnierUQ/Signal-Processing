# Signal-Processing
Variety of signal processing related projects that I find incredibly interesting. Implementations of various algorithms and code I wrote for uni assignments.

###Radix 4 Cooley Tuckey Algorithm Implementation
Written in MATLAB, the Cooley Tuckey Algorithm is a simple way to implement a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), by essentially breaking down a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) into many smaller DFT's.
